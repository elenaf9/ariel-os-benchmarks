# bench_lock

## About

This benchmark tests triggering the scheduler without a context switch performance.

**Unfortunately, the required `riot_rs_threads::schedule` function for this benchmark is private.
It must be changed locally to public in the checked-out `$HOME/.cargo/git/checkouts/<path-to-riot-rs-rev>`.**
